Welcome to Melodify!

Project Description:

Objectives: The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and user-friendly music player application using Python. This application will leverage the power of a circular doubly linked list data structure to efficiently manage and play a collection of songs. By implementing features such as adding, removing, and shuffling songs, as well as controlling playback functions like play, pause, and skip, we aim to create a seamless and enjoyable music listening experience.

Language: Python will be the primary programming language used to implement this music player application.

Design: To control playback, the music player will implement the following functions: Pause temporarily stops the current song, allowing users to resume playback later. Next advances to the next song in the playlist, moving the current pointer to the subsequent node in the circular linked list. Prev rewinds to the previous song, shifting the current pointer to the preceding node. Add Song inserts a new song into the playlist.

Concept: A circular doubly linked list is the optimal data structure for a music player. Each node in the list represents a song, storing details like title, artist, and file path. The 'next' pointer in each node points to the subsequent song, while the 'prev' pointer points to the preceding song. This circular arrangement enables seamless playback, where the last song's 'next' pointer leads back to the first song, and vice versa. This design allows for effortless navigation, looping, and shuffling of the playlist.

Requirement: Make sure you have the following installed: - Python 3.8+ - Tkinter: Pre-installed with most Python distributions. - Pygame: For audio playback.


How to Run the code:

In the project folder, do the following:

Add a ‘graphics’ folder. Inside the folder, add the images/icons provided in this folder. (play_button, pause_button, previous_button, next_button). Or if you wish to change the icons, make sure to name the file as it is and it should be in .png format.
Add a ‘music_folder. Inside the folder, add your favorite music in .mp3 format. Make sure that the songs are named as <artist>-<title>.mp3.
Lastly, add the MELODIFY.py 
Run the project.
